# Model Predictive Control Lecture

This repository stores my programming exercises for the Model Predict Control lecture (151-0660-00) at ETH Zurich in Spring 2019. My cheatsheet for the final exam is also included in <code>doc</code>. In this project, model predictive control methods were applied to find the best inputs given certain constraints and requirements. The problem description and my report can be found under <code>doc</code>.

## Evaluation

- Full grade granted

## Requirement

- MATLAB
- Yalmip
- FORCES Pro (for `controller_mpc_1_forces.m`)

## Usage

- Run `run_simulations.m`under `src` folder.

- To test different methods, pass the method name as the second argument to the function `simulate_truck`.
